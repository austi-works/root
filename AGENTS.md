# Agent Instructions

Always try to keep changes minimal and focused.

Never run application unless user explicitly asks for it.

If you need additional information about library use context7.

## Package Manager

Always use `bun` and `bunx` for running commands.
Never use `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.

## Packages and code conventions

When adding a workspace package under `packages/`, follow [.docs/package-creation.md](.docs/package-creation.md).

For import aliases and related rules (`#` inside packages, `@workspace/`, third-party imports), see [.docs/code-conventions.md](.docs/code-conventions.md).

## Code Style

Prefer arrow functions over function expressions and function declarations.

For React function components, use function declarations and named exports:
`export function MyComponent() { ... }`.

Always try to DRY repeating code.

## UI Components

All shared UI primitives and shadcn-generated components live in [`packages/ui`](packages/ui) and are consumed as `@workspace/ui`. Do not add or maintain parallel design-system trees (for example `apps/*/src/components/ui/`) for the same role—extend or compose the shared package instead.

**Do not modify files under `packages/ui/src/components/ui/`** or other vendored UI directories under `packages/ui` except through the intended tooling—these are library-style components from shadcn/ui and should be treated as read-only.

If you need custom behavior, create a wrapper component in the consuming app (or another package) instead of editing the primitives in `packages/ui`.

Add new shadcn components with `bun run ui:add <component>` from the monorepo root or from [`packages/ui`](packages/ui).

## AI Library

Use `@tanstack/ai` for the AI library.

## Convex

Assume Convex codegen stays in sync while `bun run austi:convex` or `bun run trading:convex` runs from the monorepo root (each resolves the matching app’s `convex/` folder).

## UI / Theming

Do not introduce raw Tailwind color classes (e.g. `emerald-500`, `red-500`, `green-400`) in app code under `src/`. Use semantic tokens from the theme: `background`, `foreground`, `primary`, `muted`, `success`, `warning`, `danger`, `destructive`, etc.

See [.docs/ui-theming.md](.docs/ui-theming.md) for the full token reference, signal-to-token mapping (bullish→success, bearish→danger), radius scale, and the recipe for adding new tokens.

For the Austi app, the default visual direction is minimal, flat and monochrome: do not use cards
for page layout.

<!-- convex-ai-start -->

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read
`convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on
how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that
override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running
`npx convex ai-files install`.
