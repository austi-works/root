    question: 'What is Austi?',
    answer:
      'Austi is an AI maintenance coordinator for property managers and multi-property landlords. It receives repair reports, gathers the details, follows the owner’s operating policies, coordinates an approved contractor and keeps the case moving until the work is recorded as complete.',
  },
  {
    group: 'product',
    question: 'What maintenance work does Austi handle?',
    answer:
      'The closed alpha covers the work around a repair: receiving the report, asking follow-up questions, assessing urgency, checking policy, requesting approval when needed, contacting contractors, scheduling access, sending updates, following up and recording the outcome.',
  },
  {
    group: 'product',
    question: 'Does Austi handle leasing, rent collection or inspections?',
    answer:
      'Not in the current alpha. Austi is focused on maintenance first. Leasing, rent collection, inspections and broader tenant support are planned for later.',
  },
  {
    group: 'product',
    question: 'How can tenants report a problem?',
    answer:
      'Reports can arrive by phone, email, WhatsApp, SMS or web chat. Messages from each channel stay attached to the same maintenance case.',
  },
  {
    group: 'operation',
    question: 'How much can Austi do without approval?',
    answer:
      'Within the maintenance workflow, Austi can carry out any action covered by policies set by the property owner. Those policies define urgency, responsibility, approval limits, contractor choices and the points where a manager must decide.',
  },
  {
    group: 'operation',
    question: 'Can we keep our existing contractors?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Austi works only with your existing contractor network. You choose the approved contractors for each property and trade.',
  },
  {
    group: 'operation',
    question: 'What happens when a case falls outside our policy?',
    answer:
      'The agent automatically notifies the manager, shares the information collected so far and waits for a decision. Work resumes once the manager gives direction.',
  },
  {
    group: 'operation',
    question: 'How does Austi handle emergencies?',
    answer:
      'Emergency reports follow the escalation policy set by the property owner. When the situation requires a decision outside Austi’s approved actions, the manager is notified automatically and the agent waits for direction.',
  },
  {
    group: 'operation',
    question: 'Does Austi replace our PMS?',
    answer:
      'No. Your PMS remains the source of truth. During the alpha, we are working with operators to decide which integrations and write-back workflows matter first, so we do not claim compatibility with named platforms yet.',
  },
  {
    group: 'operation',
    question: 'What does Austi record?',
    answer:
      'Reports, messages, policy checks, approvals, contractor responses, appointments and outcomes stay attached to the maintenance case. The final record is prepared for your PMS; how it is written back depends on your setup and the integrations chosen during the alpha.',
  },

    question: 'Who is Austi for?',
    answer:
      'The current alpha is designed for property managers and multi-property landlords in Lithuania and Poland.',

    question: 'Is Austi available today?',

  },
  {
    group: 'stage',
    question: 'How is tenant and property data handled?',
